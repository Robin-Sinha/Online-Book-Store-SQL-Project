# Online-Book-Store-SQL-Project
ðŸ“˜ Bookstore SQL Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a Bookstore Management Database built using SQL.
It simulates a small bookstoreâ€™s system where we can manage:

ðŸ“š Books

ðŸ‘¥ Customers

ðŸ›’ Orders

The project demonstrates the creation of relational tables, relationships, and a variety of SQL queries (basic and advanced) to answer common business questions.

ðŸ—‚ Database Schema

Books: Stores book details (title, author, genre, year, price, stock).

Customers: Stores customer details (name, email, phone, city, country).

Orders: Stores order details (customer, book purchased, quantity, total amount).

ðŸ”‘ Features & Queries

The project includes SQL queries to handle both basic and advanced scenarios:

ðŸ”¹ Basic Queries

Retrieve all books in a specific genre (e.g., Fiction).

Find books published after a certain year.

List customers from a specific country.

Show orders placed in a particular month.

Calculate the total stock of books available.

Find the most expensive book.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack

SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible)

Can be executed in tools like pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench, or Azure Data Studio

ðŸš€ How to Use

Run the script in your SQL environment.

The tables (Books, Customers, Orders) will be created.

Insert sample data (optional).

Execute queries to explore bookstore insights.

ðŸ“ˆ Learning Outcomes

Hands-on practice with DDL (CREATE, DROP) and DML (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, HAVING).

Use of aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX).

Exposure to advanced SQL concepts like JOIN, DISTINCT, COALESCE, ORDER BY, LIMIT.

Simulating real-world business queries for data analysis.
